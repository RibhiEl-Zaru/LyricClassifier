Ooh, swim in it, ooh, let me touch it
Turn around girl, let me bust it
Running back, running back, rush it

Dior suit, take the arm and I cuff it
Trust no one for nothing, run up and they bust it
Take xans til I stumble, full bars now I punt em

You could leave em in the desert
They some dogs need a muzzle
Baby girl turn around, I do not wanna cuddle
