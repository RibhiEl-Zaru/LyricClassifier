To Zion
Lauryn Hill


[Intro]
One day, you'll understand... Zion

[Verse 1]
Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
"Look at your career," they said
"Lauryn baby use your head."
But instead I chose to use my heart

[Hook]
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!)
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, uhh, Zion!)

[Verse 2]
How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you my Prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

[Hook]

[Skit]

Teacher: Okay, now how many people here have ever been in love? I know none of the guys are gonna raise their hand. How many of y'all ever been in love?

(Mumbling)

Teacher: I know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? Oh! Let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, cos not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. About your personal definition, don't tell me what Webster thinks. Huh?

Boy: Willingness to do everything for that person

Teacher: Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But he wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

Boy: The way they act

Teacher: Uh-huh

Boy: The way they carry themselves, stuff like that

Teacher: Okay

Girl: Boys that, they just stand out
