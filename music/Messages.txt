[Intro]
Ayy, yeah, Matt OX
Yeah, ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah

[Verse]
Messages, yeah, I check my messages
She been textin' me, she been trippin', man
Think I'm chasin' her, but I'm chasin' bands
Ay, you not my bro, yeah, you not my mans
I got Saint Laurent, all up on my shades
And I got the Benjis, all up in my bands
All up in my pants, I've been hustlin'
They a bunch of lames, I can't hang with them
And I treat your main like a side chick
I've been runnin' up, they've been takin' flicks
She ain't bang with me 'til she saw my chain
On a new level, in a new lane
When she look at it, all she saw was ring
Fiji on my wrist, watch the diamonds bling
Watch the diamonds sing
Yeah that's how I do my dance
If you're talkin', catch these hands
Make it out of the badlands
Spittin' fire on the damn track
If I got the mic, I never lack
I don't sleep, I don't take naps
I'm just ballin' with my squad
Yeah I swear I love my brothers
We gon' make it to the top charts
This is only the damn start, yeah

[Outro]
Only the damn start
