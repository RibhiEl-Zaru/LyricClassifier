Getting data:

Criteria:
  - Needed a large amount of songs
  - Data should be evenly/realistically distributed among genres
  - Solution: Best albums lists (more bang for buck)
    - Still have to worry bout distribution issues
        - Especially if certain genres tend to have longer albums

Implementation difficulties:
  - Process is slow b/c extensive use of online APIs
  - Text parsing difficulties
  - Most albums are classic, so APIs return deluxe/rare editions
    -Produces duplicate songs/ones not on Genius
